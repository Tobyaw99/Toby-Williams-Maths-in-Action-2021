# Toby-Williams-Maths-in-Action-2021

This project contains all the relevant code for my maths in action project on COVID-19 modelling.

The most importnat file is the models.py file, this is what defines the different types of model and contains all the equations that are used. The constants.py file includes the data for all the constants used in the project. All the other files in this repository are files of simulations that produce results and graphs that are used in the report.
